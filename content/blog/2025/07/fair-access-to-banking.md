Financial services have gone on a tear and purged hundreds of mature video games across multiple platforms.  More people than ever now recognize the imminent danger that these unaccountable multi-billion dollar corporations pose to our freedoms.  Lawmakers in the Senate have proposed the _Fair Access to Banking Act_ (S.401). It is a step in the right direction, not a silver bullet - but it could be.

_You may review the text of the bill on [Congress's website](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/401)._

## The Gordian Knot of Financial Services
By design, understanding how a credit card transaction works is very hard. There are many layers of abstraction, up to six different companies between each card swipe and the seller receiving money. Each of these steps between you and your seller is a bottleneck and single point of failure.

These are:
* The _Issuing Bank_, your bank who issued you your debit or credit card.
* The _Payment Gateway_, which captures your card information at the point of sale.
* The _Payment Processor_, which receives data, processes the request, and does fraud checks.
* The _Payment Facilitator_ (PayFac), which maintains relationships with the _Acquiring Banks_ on behalf of many merchants.
* The _Acquiring Bank_, responsible for underwriting merchants and settling transactions.
* The _Card Network_, which is the network that connects the _Issuing Bank_ to the _Acquiring Bank_, such as Visa or Mastercard, and also sets rules and standards.

Each of these companies maintains its own terms of service and each of them can block a transaction by themselves. Additionally, intermediary companies that handle card transactions are mutually and individually bound to the terms of every Card Network, so even if you never do business with Discover or American Express, you must still obey their rules if you want to accept Visa or Mastercard. You don't get to choose what card networks you patrionize: if you want to do e-commerce, you will obey all of them.

If you are banned from processing payments, you will not be informed why or by which point of failure. "Risk management" is considered a trade secret in the industry. You have no right to know, you cannot sue to discover what has happened, and you also have no right to appeal. These are private companies and they can do whatever they want, even if it is not in the best interest of their customers.

### What the _Fair Access to Banking Act_ does
The bill sets rules for a variety of financial institutions (banks and credit unions) and financial services (card networks and their partners). It is designed to prevent them from blocking access to their services based on "political or reputational risk considerations." Theoretically, all legal businesses should be protected.

Financial services have blocked businesses for a myriad of political reasons. Examples include abortion clinics, gun stores, fossil fuel industries, and even some charities. The bill aims to prevent this by ensuring that financial institutions cannot discriminate against businesses based on their political or reputational risk.

Banks and Credit Unions are the most heavily targeted by this legislation. In particular, any FDIC members and NCUA members found to be in violation of the law would be banned from accessing the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network. This would effectively deny them the ability to transfer funds to and from other banks and is a very strong incentive to comply and work with their members before denying them services.

### What the act _does not_ do
The law lacks teeth for financial services: the payment networks and payment processors. Financial institutions (banks and credit unions) are not the issue. There are over 9000 such institutions accredited by the FDIC and NCUA. If you are kicked out by your bank, it is fairly easy to find another. Brick and mortar banks have healthy competition, and banks like Old Glory Bank have been started recently specifically to provide banking services to risky businesses.

Lets focus on payment networks. Section 5 states:

>SEC. 5. Payment card network.
>
>(a) Definition.—In this section, the term “payment card network” has the meaning given the term in section 921(c) of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693o–2(c)).
>
>(b) Prohibition.—No payment card network, including a subsidiary of a payment card network, may, directly or through any agent, processor, or licensed member of the network, by contract, requirement, condition, penalty, or otherwise, prohibit or inhibit the ability of any person who is in compliance with the law, including section 8 of this Act, to obtain access to services or products of the payment card network because of political or reputational risk considerations.
>
>(c) Civil penalty.—Any payment card network that violates subsection (b) shall be assessed a civil penalty by the Comptroller of the Currency of not more than 10 percent of the value of the services or products described in that subsection, not to exceed $10,000 per violation.


Pay special attention to (c). The penalty for violating this law is extremely weak and actually unenforceable.

* Card networks are only on the hook for 10% of the damages they cause.
* The penalty is capped at $10,000 per violation. Visa alone processed $16 **trillion** in 2024.
* The penalty is imposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, at their discretion. They are not required to impose a penalty, and they are not required to impose the maximum penalty.
* In 2024, the Supreme Court in _SEC v. Jarkesy_ ruled that Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) are unconstitutional, so the OCC cannot use ALJs to impose penalties. They must go through the courts, which is a lengthy and expensive process. Unless it is politically expedient for them, the OCC would never consider pursuing a case against a card network.

### What the act _should_ do
The issue of payments is by its nature financial. To make the economic penalties effective enough to deter censorious behavior, there must be relief available to those impacted by the actions of the card networks and their partners.

For instance, the Bill should:
* provide civil relief to injured parties, allowing them to sue in federal court without permission from a regulatory body,
* provide punitive damages on top of the full value of the services or products denied, and
* provide for attorney's fees and costs to the injured party should they prevail in court.

These would significantly shift the balance of power away from the card networks and their partners and back towards the legal businesses that they serve. They would be heavily incentivized to work with their customers, provide human support, transparent appeals processes, and other ways to resolve disputes out of court. That is what Americans deserve.
