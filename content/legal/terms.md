Welcome to a website operated by the United States Internet Preservation Society ("USIPS", "the Society", "we", "our", "us").

The Site includes the Society's website at usips.org. In addition to the Site, this User Agreement may also apply and govern your use of any mobile application, online service, or platform operated by USIPS that link to this User Agreement. This User Agreement also does not apply to Digital Services that USIPS does not operate where an USIPS entity has a presence, such as USIPS pages on Facebook. Finally, this is not the User Agreement for the websites of any USIPS local/state/territory affiliated organizations (“Affiliates”). In all those cases, site-specific terms of use apply, and are posted accordingly.

### Trademarks (Including Logos)

UNITED STATES INTERNET PRESERVATION SOCIETY, USIPS, USIPS logos (including the Sisyphus logo), and any other trademarks on the USIPS Site (collectively "USIPS Trademarks") are trademarks of USIPS in the United States and other countries unless it is explicitly stated on the USIPS Site where a trademark appears that the trademark is the trademark of a third party (or it is obvious from the context that it is the trademark of a third party; e.g., where we include on the USIPS Site the name or logo of a coalition partner) ("Third-Party Trademarks"). To the extent your use of USIPS Trademarks does not constitute "fair use" for which you do not need our permission, the following rules apply to use of the material:

You may not use the USIPS Trademarks for any product or service that does not belong to the USIPS, nor in any manner that is likely to cause confusion about whether we are the source, affiliated with, sponsor of, or endorser of any product, service, event, or organization. Further, you will not use the USIPS Trademarks in connection with any content that makes direct or indirect reference to, features or otherwise depicts any candidate for elective office. In addition, you may not use the USIPS Trademarks in any manner that illegally disparages or discredits us.

Your ability to use a Third-Party Trademark that appears on the USIPS Site is limited to the manner, if any, in which the USIPS Site explicitly states on the page on which such Third-Party Trademark appears that such use in such manner is authorized by the third-party owner of that Third-Party Trademark (unless your use is permissible under the law [e.g., it is "fair use"] or the owner of such Third-Party Trademark has specifically granted you the right to such use in such manner).

## Refund Policy
**Donations**: Donations are refundable within 30 days of the donation date. Requests must be submitted in writing to our support team.

**Merchandise Sales**: Merchandise purchases are refundable within 90 days of the sale date, provided items are unused and in original condition.


## Links and Frames
