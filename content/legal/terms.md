Welcome to a website operated by the United States Internet Preservation Society ("USIPS", "the Society", "we", "our", "us").

The Site includes the Society's website at usips.org. In addition to the Site, this User Agreement may also apply and govern your use of any mobile application, online service, or platform operated by USIPS that link to this User Agreement. This User Agreement also does not apply to Digital Services that USIPS does not operate where an USIPS entity has a presence, such as USIPS pages on Facebook. Finally, this is not the User Agreement for the websites of any USIPS local/state/territory affiliated organizations (“Affiliates”). In all those cases, site-specific terms of use apply, and are posted accordingly.

When you continue to use the USIPS Site after we post a change, it means you agree to the new rules.

### Trademarks (Including Logos)

UNITED STATES INTERNET PRESERVATION SOCIETY, USIPS, USIPS logos (including the Sisyphus logo), and any other trademarks on the USIPS Site (collectively "USIPS Trademarks") are trademarks of USIPS in the United States and other countries unless it is explicitly stated on the USIPS Site where a trademark appears that the trademark is the trademark of a third party (or it is obvious from the context that it is the trademark of a third party; e.g., where we include on the USIPS Site the name or logo of a coalition partner) ("Third-Party Trademarks"). To the extent your use of USIPS Trademarks does not constitute "fair use" for which you do not need our permission, the following rules apply to use of the material:

You may not use the USIPS Trademarks for any product or service that does not belong to the USIPS, nor in any manner that is likely to cause confusion about whether we are the source, affiliated with, sponsor of, or endorser of any product, service, event, or organization. Further, you will not use the USIPS Trademarks in connection with any content that makes direct or indirect reference to, features or otherwise depicts any candidate for elective office. In addition, you may not use the USIPS Trademarks in any manner that illegally disparages or discredits us.

Your ability to use a Third-Party Trademark that appears on the USIPS Site is limited to the manner, if any, in which the USIPS Site explicitly states on the page on which such Third-Party Trademark appears that such use in such manner is authorized by the third-party owner of that Third-Party Trademark (unless your use is permissible under the law [e.g., it is "fair use"] or the owner of such Third-Party Trademark has specifically granted you the right to such use in such manner).

## Links and Frames

You may link to the USIPS as long as the link does not falsely imply association. You may not use metatags or any other "hidden text" that incorporates USIPS Trademarks or our name without our express written consent.

## Links to Other Websites

The USIPS Site contains links to other websites that we think may be of interest to you. We are not responsible for and have no control over these other sites or their content. Remember that when you link to another site, that other site is governed by its own user agreement and privacy statement, which you should be sure to read.

## Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

ALTHOUGH WE TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PREVENT THE INTRODUCTION OF VIRUSES, WORMS, "TROJAN HORSES," OR OTHER DESTRUCTIVE MATERIALS TO THE USIPS SITE, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT THE USIPS SITE OR MATERIALS THAT MAY BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE USIPS SITE ARE FREE FROM SUCH DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR HARM ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH FEATURES.

WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS, OR INJURY BASED ON ERRORS, OMISSIONS, INTERRUPTIONS. OR OTHER INACCURACIES IN THE USIPS SITE, NOR FOR ANY CLAIM, LOSS. OR INJURY THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR USE OF THE USIPS SITE OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS USER AGREEMENT.

## Termination

We reserve the right to terminate the USIPS Site and this User Agreement at any time without notice for any reason, including, in the case of the User Agreement, for your violation of any of its provisions. The Limitation of Liability and Governing Law Sections of this User Agreement survive any such termination.

This User Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts made and performed there without regard to its conflicts of law principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State and County of New York and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
