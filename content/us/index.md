We are committed to defending digital rights and ensuring technology serves humanity, not the other way around. Our core mission focuses on several critical areas that shape our digital future:

## [Fair Access to Financial Services](/issues/fair-access-to-financial-services/)

We believe that access to financial services is a fundamental right in the modern world. We advocate for:

- Preventing discrimination in financial services based on political views or social media activity
- Supporting open banking initiatives and financial technology innovation
- Fighting against arbitrary account closures and financial censorship
- Promoting privacy-preserving payment systems

## [Depoliticizing Internet Service Providers](/issues/impartial-internet-service)

Internet access has become as essential as electricity or water. We work towards:

- Maintaining net neutrality principles
- Preventing ISPs from becoming arbiters of content
- Ensuring equal access regardless of political views
- Supporting community-owned Internet infrastructure
- Fighting against surveillance and data retention mandates

## [Consumer Privacy Protection](/issues/consumer-privacy/)

In an age of ubiquitous data collection, privacy must be protected. We advocate for:

- Strict limits on data collection and retention
- An end to the surveillance advertising model
- Right to be forgotten and data portability
- Opt-in only data collection
- Ban on cross-site tracking without explicit consent
- Meaningful penalties for data breaches and misuse

## [Copyright Reform and Free Speech](/issues/creativity-and-expression/)

Copyright law should protect creators while preserving free speech. We fight for:

- Reform of DMCA takedown procedures to prevent abuse
- Stronger fair use protections
- Penalties for bad-faith takedown requests
- Protection of transformative works
- Preservation of anonymous speech
- Resistance against automated content filtering
