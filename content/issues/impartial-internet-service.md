A handfull of companies control Internet access in America, and they should be required to play fair with all customers.

The Internet is held together by a few massive Internet service providers called "Internet backbones". Despite their enormous power, ISPs are not regulated as Common Carriers like electric companies are. This means that they can, and do, discriminate against traffic based on its source or destination.

ISPs in the United States should be required to do business with all legitimate American companies. Even the most imporant backbones will pick and choose customers to avoid dealing with complaints. This is not acceptable and endangers the free flow of information. Americans should be allowed to connect to any website they want, and any legal website should be able to expect uninterrupted service from their providers.

Worse, large Internet Backbone companies will block services that are customers of their customers. So, despite not having a direct relationship with that company, they can and will enforce their arbitrary decisions downstream on legal American companies.

Americans deserve high quality, unmetered, and unmitigated Internet connections. It is an essential part of daily life and should not be subject to the whims of a corporation.
