The Internet is comprised of many smaller networks called ISPs. There are now fewer ISPs than ever before, and the US relies more than ever on a handful of very large "Internet Backbones". Despite their enormous power, ISPs are not regulated as Common Carriers. This means that they can, and do, legally discriminate against traffic based on its source or destination.

All ISPs that operate in the United States should be required to do business with all legitimate American companies. Currently, ISPs are very politically active, and even the most imporant backbones will pick and choose customers to avoid dealing with complaints. This is not acceptable and endangers the free flow of information.

Americans deserve high quality, unmetered, and unmitigated Internet connections. It is an essential part of daily life and should not be subject to the whims of a corporation.
